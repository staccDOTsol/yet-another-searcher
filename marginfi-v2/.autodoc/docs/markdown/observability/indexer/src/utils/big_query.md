This code defines two table schemas for use with Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery service in the marginfi-v2 project. The first schema, TRANSACTION_SCHEMA, describes the fields of a table that will store transaction data. The second schema, ACCOUNT_SCHEMA, describes the fields of a table that will store account data. 

Each schema is defined using the TableSchema struct from the gcp_bigquery_client::model module. The TableSchema constructor takes a vector of TableFieldSchema objects, which define the fields of the table. Each TableFieldSchema object specifies the name and data type of a field. 

For example, the TRANSACTION_SCHEMA includes fields for the transaction ID, creation and execution timestamps, signature, indexing address, slot, signer, success status, version, fee, metadata, and message. Each field is defined using a TableFieldSchema constructor method, such as string() for string fields, timestamp() for timestamp fields, big_numeric() for numeric fields, and bool() for boolean fields. 

The ACCOUNT_SCHEMA includes fields for the account ID, creation and update timestamps, owner, slot, public key, lamports balance, executable status, rent epoch, and data. 

The code also defines a constant NOT_FOUND_CODE with a value of 404, which may be used elsewhere in the project to indicate a resource was not found. 

Finally, the code defines a constant DATE_FORMAT_STR with a value of "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", which specifies the format for date and time strings used in the table schemas. 

Overall, this code provides a reusable and standardized way to define the structure of tables for storing transaction and account data in BigQuery. Other parts of the marginfi-v2 project can use these schemas to ensure consistency and compatibility when working with these tables. For example, when inserting data into the tables, the data must conform to the schema's field types and names. When querying the tables, the results will be returned in the same format as the schema.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `gcp_bigquery_client` and `lazy_static` crates being used in this code?
   
   A smart developer might wonder why these specific crates are being used and what functionality they provide. `gcp_bigquery_client` is likely being used to interact with Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery service, while `lazy_static` is being used to create static variables that are lazily initialized.

2. What is the significance of the `TRANSACTION_SCHEMA` and `ACCOUNT_SCHEMA` variables?
   
   A smart developer might want to know what these variables represent and how they are being used. These variables are `TableSchema` objects that define the schema for tables in a database. They likely represent the structure of transaction and account data that is being stored in BigQuery.

3. Why is the `DATE_FORMAT_STR` constant defined as a string?
   
   A smart developer might question why the date format is being defined as a string rather than a more specific data type. The `DATE_FORMAT_STR` constant is likely being used to format timestamps as strings for display or storage purposes. Defining it as a string allows for flexibility in how the timestamp is formatted.
