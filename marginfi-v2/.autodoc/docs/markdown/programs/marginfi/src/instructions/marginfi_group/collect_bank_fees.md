The `lending_pool_collect_bank_fees` function is responsible for collecting fees from a lending pool bank and distributing them to the appropriate vaults. This function is part of the `marginfi-v2` project and is located in a file within the project.

The function takes in a context object that contains various accounts, including the lending pool bank, liquidity vault authority, insurance vault, fee vault, liquidity vault, and the token program. The function first loads the lending pool bank and then calculates the available liquidity in the liquidity vault. It then calculates the insurance fee transfer amount and the new outstanding insurance fees. The function then subtracts the insurance fee transfer amount from the available liquidity and calculates the group fee transfer amount and the new outstanding group fees. The function then withdraws the fees from the liquidity vault and transfers them to the appropriate vaults.

The function emits a `LendingPoolBankCollectFeesEvent` event that contains information about the fees collected and the outstanding fees. The event is emitted using the `emit!` macro from the `anchor_lang` crate.

The `LendingPoolCollectBankFees` struct is a helper struct that defines the accounts required by the `lending_pool_collect_bank_fees` function. The struct is derived using the `Accounts` attribute from the `anchor_lang` crate.

Overall, this function is an important part of the `marginfi-v2` project as it ensures that fees are collected and distributed correctly. It is likely used in conjunction with other functions to manage the lending pool and ensure that it operates smoothly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function `lending_pool_collect_bank_fees` that collects fees from a lending pool bank and transfers them to the appropriate vaults.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `lending_pool_collect_bank_fees` function?
- The function takes in several accounts including the lending pool bank, various vaults, and the token program. It does not have any explicit outputs, but it emits a `LendingPoolBankCollectFeesEvent` event.

3. What is the role of the `bank_signer!` macro in this code?
- The `bank_signer!` macro generates a signer for the bank account based on the type of vault being used (liquidity or insurance) and the bank's key and bump values. This signer is used to authorize transfers out of the vaults.
