This code defines various constants and types used in the MarginFi-v2 project. 

The constants `LIQUIDITY_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`, `INSURANCE_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`, and `FEE_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED` are used as seeds to derive the public keys of the corresponding vault authorities. Similarly, `LIQUIDITY_VAULT_SEED`, `INSURANCE_VAULT_SEED`, and `FEE_VAULT_SEED` are used as seeds to derive the public keys of the corresponding vaults. These seeds are used in other parts of the project to generate the necessary public keys.

The `PYTH_ID` constant is a public key that is different depending on whether the project is running on the mainnet-beta or devnet network. This key is used to fetch price data from the Pyth network.

The `LIQUIDATION_LIQUIDATOR_FEE` and `LIQUIDATION_INSURANCE_FEE` constants represent the fees charged during liquidation of a position. These fees are fixed at 2.5% each.

The `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` constant represents the number of seconds in a year and is used in calculating the interest rate for borrowing.

The `MAX_PRICE_AGE_SEC` constant represents the maximum age of a price in seconds that is considered valid. Prices older than this value are not used in calculations.

The `CONF_INTERVAL_MULTIPLE` constant represents the multiple of the standard deviation that is used to calculate the confidence interval for price data. This value is set to 2.12, which corresponds to a 95% confidence interval.

The `USDC_EXPONENT` constant represents the number of decimal places in a USDC token.

The `MAX_ORACLE_KEYS` constant represents the maximum number of oracle keys that can be used in a single position.

The `EMPTY_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` constant represents the minimum balance that is considered non-zero. Any balance below this value is treated as zero.

The `ZERO_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD` constant represents the threshold used to compare balances and account for any artifacts resulting from binary fraction arithmetic.

Overall, this code defines various constants and types that are used throughout the MarginFi-v2 project to generate public keys, fetch price data, calculate fees and interest rates, and handle balances.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cfg_if` block and how does it work?
- The `cfg_if` block is used to conditionally compile code based on the current feature flag. It checks if the `mainnet-beta` or `devnet` feature is enabled and sets the `PYTH_ID` constant accordingly.

2. What is the significance of the `LIQUIDATION_LIQUIDATOR_FEE` and `LIQUIDATION_INSURANCE_FEE` constants?
- These constants represent the fees charged during liquidation events and are currently set to 0.025 (2.5%). They are currently not variable per bank, but this may change in the future.

3. What is the purpose of the `CONF_INTERVAL_MULTIPLE` constant and how is it calculated?
- The `CONF_INTERVAL_MULTIPLE` constant represents the range that contains 95% of the price data distribution and is calculated to be 2.12 based on Pyth Network's best practices documentation. It is used in price feed calculations.
