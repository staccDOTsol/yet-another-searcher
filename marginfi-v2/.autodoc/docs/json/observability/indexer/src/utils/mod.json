  "summary": "This code is a module that imports three other modules: `big_query`, `protos`, and `transactions_crawler`. These modules likely contain code related to interacting with Google's BigQuery service, protocol buffers, and crawling transaction data, respectively. \n\nThe purpose of this module is to provide access to these other modules within the larger `marginfi-v2` project. By importing these modules, other parts of the project can use their functionality without having to rewrite the code. \n\nFor example, if another module in the `marginfi-v2` project needs to interact with BigQuery, it can simply import the `big_query` module from this file and use its functions. Similarly, if another module needs to crawl transaction data, it can import the `transactions_crawler` module. \n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used in another part of the `marginfi-v2` project:\n\n```rust\n// Import the big_query module from the marginfi_v2::utils module\nuse marginfi_v2::utils::big_query;\n\n// Call a function from the big_query module to query data from BigQuery\nlet results = big_query::query(\"SELECT * FROM my_table\");\n```\n\nOverall, this module serves as a way to organize and modularize the code in the `marginfi-v2` project, making it easier to maintain and update in the future.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `big_query` module?** \nThe `big_query` module is likely responsible for interacting with Google's BigQuery service, but without further information it is unclear what specific functionality it provides.\n\n2. **What is the `protos` module used for?** \nThe `protos` module may contain protocol buffer definitions for the project, which are used for serializing and deserializing data between different systems or languages.\n\n3. **What does the `transactions_crawler` module do?** \nThe `transactions_crawler` module is likely responsible for crawling or scraping data related to transactions, but without further information it is unclear what specific data sources it targets or how it processes the data."
