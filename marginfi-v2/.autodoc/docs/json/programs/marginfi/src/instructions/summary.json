This allows other parts of the project to access the functionality provided by these modules without having to import them directly. \n\nFor example, if another module in the project needs to use a function or struct defined in `marginfi_account`, it can simply import this module using `use marginfi_account::*` instead of having to import the module directly. \n\nThis code follows the Rust convention of organizing code into modules, which helps to keep the codebase organized and maintainable. By breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable pieces, it becomes easier to reason about the code and make changes without introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality. \n\nOverall, this code is a small but important part of the MarginFi-v2 project, providing a way to access the functionality provided by the `marginfi_account` and `marginfi_group` modules throughout the rest of the codebase.",
