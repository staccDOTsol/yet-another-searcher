# Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth - a Geyser based gRPC interface for Solana

This repo contains a fully functional gRPC interface for Solana. It is built around Solana's Geyser interface. In this repo we have the plugin as well as sample clients for multiple languages.

It provides the ability to get slots, blocks, transactions, and account update notifications over a standardised path. 

For additional documentation,  please see: https://docs.triton.one/rpc-pool/grpc-subscriptions

#### Known bugs

Block reconstruction inside gRPC plugin based on information provided by BlockMeta, unfortunately number of entries for blocks generated on validators always equal to zero. These blocks always will have zero entries. See issue on GitHub: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/33823

### Validator

Current plugin version (`+solana.1.16.x`) use validator with backported `ReplicaBlockInfoV3` to Geyser interface — https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/33359. As result it's not compatible with original validator from Solana Labs and would not work. You need to compile validator from the source code and can find patched releases in `Triton One` Solana fork: https://github.com/rpcpool/solana-public/tree/v1.16.16-geyser-block-v3.

```bash
$ solana-validator --geyser-plugin-config yellowstone-grpc-geyser/config.json
```

### Plugin config check

```
cargo-fmt && cargo run --bin config-check -- --config yellowstone-grpc-geyser/config.json
```

### Block reconstruction

Geyser interface on block update do not provide detailed information about transactions and accounts updates. To provide this information with block message we need to collect all messages and expect specified order. By default if we failed to reconstruct full block we log error message and increase `invalid_full_blocks_total` counter in prometheus metrics. If you want to panic on invalid reconstruction you can change option `block_fail_action` in config to `panic` (default value is `log`).

### Filters

See [yellowstone-grpc-proto/proto/geyser.proto](yellowstone-grpc-proto/proto/geyser.proto).

#### Slots

Currently all slots are broadcasted.

#### Account

Accounts can be filtered by:

   - `account` — acount Pubkey, match to any Pubkey from the array
   - `owner` — account owner Pubkey, match to any Pubkey from the array
   - `filters` — same as `getProgramAccounts` filters, array of `dataSize` or `Memcmp` (bytes, base58, base64 are supported)

If all fields are empty then all accounts are broadcasted. Otherwise fields works as logical `AND` and values in arrays as logical `OR` (except values in `filters` which works as logical `AND`).

#### Transactions

   - `vote` — enable/disable broadcast `vote` transactions
   - `failed` — enable/disable broadcast `failed` transactions
   - `signature` — match only specified transaction
   - `account_include` — filter transactions which use any account
   - `account_exclude` — filter transactions which do not use any account
   - `account_required` — require all accounts used in transaction

If all fields are empty then all transactions are broadcasted. Otherwise fields works as logical `AND` and values in arrays as logical `OR`.

#### Blocks

   - `account_include` — filter transactions and accounts which use any of listed accounts
   - `include_transactions` — include all transactions
   - `include_accounts` — include all accounts updates
   - `include_entries` — include all entries

Currently all blocks are broadcasted.

#### Blocks meta

Same as `Blocks` but without `transactions`.

### Limit filters

It's possible to add limits for filters in config. If `filters` field is omitted then filters doesn't have any limits.

```json
"grpc": {
   "filters": {
      "accounts": {
         "max": 1,
         "any": false,
         "account_max": 10,
         "account_reject": ["TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"],
         "owner_max": 10,
         "owner_reject": ["11111111111111111111111111111111"]
      },
      "slots": {
         "max": 1
      },
      "transactions": {
         "max": 1,
         "any": false,
         "account_include_max": 10,
         "account_include_reject": ["TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"],
         "account_exclude_max": 10
      },
      "blocks": {
         "max": 1
      }
   }
}
```

### gRPC Tools

#### Google Pub/Sub

```bash
$ cargo run --bin grpc-google-pubsub -- --help
Yellowstone gRPC Google Pub/Sub Tool

Usage: grpc-google-pubsub [OPTIONS] --config <CONFIG> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  grpc2pubsub        Receive data from gRPC and send them to the Pub/Sub
  pubsub2stdout      Dev: subscribe to message from Pub/Sub and print them to Stdout
  pubsubTopicCreate  Dev: create Pub/Sub topic
  pubsubTopicDelete  Dev: delete Pub/Sub topic
  help               Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <CONFIG>          Path to config file
      --prometheus <PROMETHEUS>  Prometheus listen address
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version
```

##### Development

```bash
# export creds
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/google/project/creds.json
# send messages from gRPC to Google Pub/Sub
cargo run --bin grpc-google-pubsub -- --config yellowstone-grpc-tools/config-google-pubsub.json grpc2pubsub
```

with emulator:

```bash
# retrive `USER_CONFIG_DIR`
$ gcloud info --format='get(config.paths.global_config_dir)'
# run emulator, data dir by default: `<USER_CONFIG_DIR>/emulators/pubsub`
$ gcloud beta emulators pubsub start
...
# send serialized gRPC messages to Google Pub/Sub with PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST
$ PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8085 cargo run --bin grpc-google-pubsub -- --config yellowstone-grpc-tools/config-google-pubsub.json grpc2pubsub
# print type of messages from Google Pub/Sub with PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST
$ PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8085 cargo run --bin grpc-google-pubsub -- --config yellowstone-grpc-tools/config-google-pubsub.json --prometheus 1 pubsub2stdout
```

#### Kafka

In addition to gRPC Geyser Plugin we provide Kafka tool. This tool can works in 3 modes:

- `grpc2kafka` — connect to gRPC with specified filter and sent all incoming messages to the Kafka
- `dedup` — consume messages from Kafka and sent deduplicated messages to another topic (right now only support `memory` as deduplication backend)
- `kafka2grpc` — provide gRPC endpoint with sending messages from Kafka

```bash
$ cargo run --bin grpc-kafka -- --help
Yellowstone gRPC Kafka Tool

Usage: grpc-kafka [OPTIONS] --config <CONFIG> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  dedup       Receive data from Kafka, deduplicate and send them back to Kafka
  grpc2kafka  Receive data from gRPC and send them to the Kafka
  kafka2grpc  Receive data from Kafka and send them over gRPC
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <CONFIG>          Path to config file
      --prometheus <PROMETHEUS>  Prometheus listen address
  -h, --help                     Print help
