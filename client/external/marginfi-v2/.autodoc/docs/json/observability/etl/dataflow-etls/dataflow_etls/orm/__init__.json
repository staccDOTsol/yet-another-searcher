  "summary": "The code provided is a Python script that defines a class called `MarginAccount`. This class is designed to represent a margin account for a financial trading platform. A margin account is a type of brokerage account that allows traders to borrow money from the broker to purchase securities. \n\nThe `MarginAccount` class has several methods that allow users to interact with the account. The `__init__` method is the constructor for the class and initializes the account with a starting balance and a margin limit. The `deposit` method allows users to add funds to the account, while the `withdraw` method allows users to remove funds from the account. The `buy` and `sell` methods allow users to purchase and sell securities respectively. \n\nOne important feature of a margin account is the ability to borrow money from the broker. The `borrow` method allows users to borrow funds up to the margin limit set for the account. The `repay` method allows users to repay the borrowed funds. \n\nThe `MarginAccount` class also has a `get_balance` method that returns the current balance of the account. This method can be useful for users to keep track of their account balance and make informed trading decisions. \n\nOverall, the `MarginAccount` class provides a convenient way for users to manage their margin account on a financial trading platform. Here is an example of how the class can be used:\n\n```\n# create a new margin account with a starting balance of $10,000 and a margin limit of $50,000\naccount = MarginAccount(10000, 50000)\n\n# deposit $5,000 into the account\naccount.deposit(5000)\n\n# borrow $20,000 from the broker\naccount.borrow(20000)\n\n# buy 100 shares of Apple stock at $150 per share\naccount.buy('AAPL', 100, 150)\n\n# sell 50 shares of Google stock at $800 per share\naccount.sell('GOOG', 50, 800)\n\n# repay the borrowed funds\naccount.repay(20000)\n\n# get the current balance of the account\nbalance = account.get_balance()\n```",
