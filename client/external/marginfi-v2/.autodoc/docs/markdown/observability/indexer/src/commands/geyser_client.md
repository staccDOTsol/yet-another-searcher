This code defines a request interceptor and a function to get a geyser client with an intercepted service. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to authenticate requests to the geyser service using an auth token. 

The `RequestInterceptor` struct implements the `Interceptor` trait from the `tonic` crate. It takes an `auth_token` string as input and adds it to the metadata of the request under the key "x-token". This allows the geyser service to authenticate the request using the provided token. 

The `get_geyser_client` function takes a `url` string and an `auth_token` string as input and returns a `Result` containing a `GeyserClient` with an intercepted service. The function first creates an `Endpoint` from the provided `url` and checks if the url contains "https". If it does, it sets up a TLS configuration for the endpoint. It then connects to the endpoint and creates a `Channel`. Finally, it creates a `GeyserClient` with an intercepted service using the `RequestInterceptor` struct and returns it as a `Result`. 

This code can be used in the larger project to authenticate requests to the geyser service. For example, if there is a need to make requests to the geyser service from different parts of the project, the `get_geyser_client` function can be called with the appropriate `url` and `auth_token` to get a `GeyserClient` with an intercepted service that can be used to make authenticated requests. 

Example usage:

```rust
let url = "https://example.com/geyser".to_string();
let auth_token = "my_auth_token".to_string();

let geyser_client = get_geyser_client(url, auth_token).await.unwrap();

let response = geyser_client.some_geyser_method(request).await.unwrap();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RequestInterceptor` struct and how is it used?
- The `RequestInterceptor` struct is used to add an authentication token to the metadata of a request. It is used as an interceptor in the `get_geyser_client` function to create a `GeyserClient` with an intercepted service that includes the `RequestInterceptor`.

2. What is the `get_geyser_client` function and what does it return?
- The `get_geyser_client` function is an asynchronous function that takes in a URL and an authentication token as parameters. It returns a `Result` containing a `GeyserClient` with an intercepted service that includes the `RequestInterceptor`.

3. What external dependencies are being used in this code?
- This code is using the `anyhow` and `tonic` crates as external dependencies. The `anyhow` crate is used for error handling and the `tonic` crate is used for building gRPC clients.
