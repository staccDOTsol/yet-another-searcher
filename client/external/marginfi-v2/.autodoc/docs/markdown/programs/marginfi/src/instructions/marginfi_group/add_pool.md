The `lending_pool_add_bank` function is used to add a new bank to the lending pool. This function is only accessible by the admin of the lending pool. The function takes in a `BankConfig` object and several accounts as arguments. The `BankConfig` object contains the configuration for the new bank being added to the lending pool. The accounts passed in include the `bank_mint`, `liquidity_vault`, `insurance_vault`, `fee_vault`, and `bank_loader`.

The function first loads the `bank` account using the `bank_loader` account. It then retrieves the bump values for the `liquidity_vault`, `liquidity_vault_authority`, `insurance_vault`, `insurance_vault_authority`, `fee_vault`, and `fee_vault_authority` accounts. These bump values are used to create the account seeds for the vaults and authorities.

The function then creates a new `Bank` object using the `Bank::new` function. This function takes in several arguments including the `MarginfiGroup` account, `BankConfig` object, `bank_mint` account, `liquidity_vault` account, `insurance_vault` account, `fee_vault` account, and the bump values for the vaults and authorities. The `Bank` object is then assigned to the `bank` account.

The function then validates the `BankConfig` object and the oracle setup. Finally, the function emits a `LendingPoolBankCreateEvent` event with the `bank_loader` and `bank_mint` accounts as arguments.

The `LendingPoolAddBank` struct is used to define the accounts required for the `lending_pool_add_bank` function. The struct includes the `marginfi_group` account, `admin` account, `bank_mint` account, `bank` account, `liquidity_vault_authority` account, `liquidity_vault` account, `insurance_vault_authority` account, `insurance_vault` account, `fee_vault_authority` account, `fee_vault` account, `rent` account, `token_program` account, and `system_program` account.

Overall, this code is used to add a new bank to the lending pool. The `BankConfig` object contains the configuration for the new bank being added to the lending pool. The `Bank` object is created using the `Bank::new` function and is assigned to the `bank` account. Finally, the function emits a `LendingPoolBankCreateEvent` event with the `bank_loader` and `bank_mint` accounts as arguments.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `lending_pool_add_bank` function?
- The `lending_pool_add_bank` function adds a new bank to the lending pool and requires admin privileges. It initializes various accounts related to the bank and emits a `LendingPoolBankCreateEvent`.

2. What are the different seeds used in the accounts defined in the `LendingPoolAddBank` struct?
- The different seeds used in the accounts defined in the `LendingPoolAddBank` struct are `LIQUIDITY_VAULT_SEED`, `INSURANCE_VAULT_SEED`, and `FEE_VAULT_SEED`. These seeds are used to derive the authority accounts for the corresponding vaults.

3. What is the purpose of the `Bank` struct and how is it initialized in the `lending_pool_add_bank` function?
- The `Bank` struct represents a bank in the lending pool and contains various fields such as the bank's mint, vaults, and configuration. In the `lending_pool_add_bank` function, a new `Bank` instance is created and initialized with the provided `bank_config` and other relevant information such as the vaults and their authorities. The `Bank` instance is then assigned to the `bank` account.
